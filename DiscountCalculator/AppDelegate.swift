// Description:
// This program illustrates the use of segues in swift and creation of graphical bar charts used to display results. The program is in essence a calculator that computes discounts and tax to a given price amount. It then displays the price to pay as well as the amount of money saved in both actual sums of money and percentages. Then the user swipes on the screen to display the bar chart that visually displays the calculations.
